# Pacman2

#### [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) is required to compile

## I had made Pacman for my final and the collisions only sort of worked. I felt like I needed to redo it. It is very different than the original, but I fixed the collisions in 5 minutes.
#### Textures and sounds and animations will come later.

## Controls
#### Use WASD or the arrow keys to change directions.
#### Use numbers 1 - 9 to change the lighting scale (I can't tell the difference past 7).

## Changes from the original
#### Pacman has a light and cannot see the ghosts until they are close.
#### The yellow bar at the top shows the remaining dots, because the dots are hard to find when you can't see the whole map.
#### Portals glow faintly, and light up at full brightness when all dots are eaten.
#### The powerups provide invincibility for 5 seconds and Pacman moves at 14 speed.
#### After all of the dots have been eaten, Pacman still needs to go through a portal to get to the next level.
#### When a ghost catches Pacman, Pacman becomes invincible for 3 seconds and all ghosts move at 1 speed. Only the ghost returns to its starting position.
#### When a ghost is targeting Pacman, the view will fade into red.
#### Bonus points are awarded for not being seen by the ghosts.
#### All speeds and timings stay the same as more levels are completed. Only the map changes. The original pacman map is first, then a random map is chosen. After all maps have been beaten or a map fails to load, the error map is created.
#### The ghosts only come in two types, Chasers and Signalers (Maybe more types later).

## Ghost types
#### Ghost default speed: 3
### Chaser Ghost
#### Count: 3<br>Chaser ghosts pick a random position on the map. If the position is valid, the ghost will move to it. Chaser ghosts move at 4 speed to get to their first position, then can chase Pacman.<br><br>Chaser ghosts move 5 speed when targeting Pacman and move at 8 speed when they have a direct line of sight with Pacman. Chaser ghosts can only track Pacman for 2 seconds.

### Signaler Ghost
#### Count: 1<br>Signaler ghosts always target Pacman, but move at 3 speed. If the Signaler ghost has a direct line of sight with Pacman, all other ghosts will target Pacman for 5 seconds.


## Custom Map Format
### [Pacman Maze Generator](https://shaunlebron.github.io/pacman-mazegen/tetris/many.htm)
### Maps are 28x31 (or 14x31) images
##### Example: 
<img src="res/maps/map0.png" width="280" height="310" style="image-rendering: pixelated"></img>
### The supported image formats are bmp, png, tga, jpg, gif, psd, hdr, and pic.
#### Only the left half of the map will be read because Pacman maps are symmetrical.<br>The right half of the map is not required for reading.
### Portals
#### Portals are not required, but the map cannot be completed. Portals are holes in the side of the top, bottom, or left sides of the map.
